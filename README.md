# MCA Rick And Morty iOS App
This project is an iOS application developed in SwiftUI and MVVM architecture. It uses the Rick and Morty API to display a list of characters and their details. The project follows a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach and uses modern technologies such as Async/Await and custom cache implementation to optimise performance.

## Tech Stack
- SwiftUI
- MVVM architecture
- Test-driven development  (TDD)
- Async/Await
- iOS 16


## Backlog
| Task | Description | Status|
| ----- | ----------- | ------ |
| Create repo and make the initial analysis of how the app will be developed. | It is the initial task where an empty project is created and all the backlog points are organised for a more optimised development.| DONE |
| Initial Project Configuration| Configure the project in Xcode with SwiftUI. | DONE |
| API Design and Testing | Design the structure of API calls with unit tests.| TODO |
| Implementing API Services | Develop and test logic to consume the Rick and Morty API. | TODO |
| Navigation Coordinator | Implement a navigation coordinator using NavigationStack. | TODO |
| Basic User Interface Design| Create a basic interface for the list of characters and details. | TODO |
| MVVM implementation| Develop ViewModels for the views, guided by TDD. | TODO |
| Error and Status Management | Implement a system for error handling and load states, including testing. | TODO |
| Image and Response Caches | Develop a cache class with unit tests. | TODO |
| UX/UI and Design Improvements in Figma | Refine the user interface and create a design system in Figma. | TODO |
| Research on Server Driven UI | Investigate how to implement Server Driven UI in the project. | TODO |


## Git Workflow
To ensure efficient and organised development, a simple Git workflow will be followed:

1. **Master Branch:** The main branch where the code is always in its most stable state.

2. **Feature Branches:** For each new feature or task, a separate branch is created (e.g., `feature/api-integration`).

3. **Commits Regulares:** Make small, frequent commits with clear and descriptive messages.

4. **Pull Requests y Code Reviews:** Although working alone, pull requests are used to merge feature branches into the main branch, allowing for self-imposed code review.

5. **Merge and Delete Feature Branches:** After a feature is completed and tested, it is merged into the main branch and the feature branch is removed to keep the repository organised.
